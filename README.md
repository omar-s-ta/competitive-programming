# Competitive Programming Repository

Welcome to my Competitive Programming repository!

This collection encompasses solutions, templates, and notes that I've compiled throughout my journey in competitive programming. It includes efficient algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques aimed at tackling various coding challenges.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **`library/`**: Contains implementations of advanced data structures and algorithms in C++.

- **`tasks/`**: Includes solutions to problems from various online judges and competitions.

- **`tasks/cp-4/`**: Includes solutions to `Competitive Programming 4` progress.

## Getting Started

To utilize the code in this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:omar-s-ta/competitive-programming.git
   ```
   The repo is based on [Alexey/Dmitriev jhelper-example](https://github.com/AlexeyDmitriev/jhelper-example-project),
   it works well with CLion and `Competitive Companion` extension.
