# Competitive Programming journey

Welcome to my ongoing Competitive Programming journey!

This collection encompasses solutions, templates, and notes that I've competitive
throughout my journey in competitive programming. It includes efficient algorithms,
data structures, and problem-solving techniques
aimed at tackling various coding challenges.

For `Rust` solutions, visit [this repo](https://github.com/omar-s-ta/rust-competitive-programming).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **`library/`**: Contains implementations of advanced data structures
  and algorithms in C++.

- **`tasks/`**: Includes solutions to problems from various online judges and competitions.

- **`tasks/cp-4/`**: [Competitive Programming 4 Book](https://cpbook.net/)
  problems solutions.

## Getting Started

To utilize the code in this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:omar-s-ta/competitive-programming.git
   ```

   The repo is based on [Alexey/Dmitriev jhelper-example](https://github.com/AlexeyDmitriev/jhelper-example-project),
   it works well with CLion and `Competitive Companion` extension.
