# Algorithmic Adventures

Welcome to my ongoing Algorithms and problem-solving adventure!

This collection encompasses solutions, templates, and notes that I've competitive
throughout my journey in competitive programming. It includes efficient algorithms,
data structures, and problem-solving techniques
aimed at tackling various coding challenges.

For `Rust` solutions, visit [this repo](https://github.com/omar-s-ta/rust-solver).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **`library/`**: Implementations of core and advanced data structures
  and algorithms. These are reusable building blocks refined throughout
  years of solving problems.

- **`tasks/`**: Includes solutions to problems from various online judges and competitions.

- **`tasks/cp-4/`**: Progress and solutions of [Competitive Programming 4](https://cpbook.net/).

The repo is based on [Alexey/Dmitriev jhelper-example](https://github.com/AlexeyDmitriev/jhelper-example-project),
it works well with CLion and `Competitive Companion` extension.
